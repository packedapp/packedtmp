/**
 * A bootstrap app is a special type of application that can be used to create other (non-bootstrap) application.
 * <p>
 * Bootstrap apps cannot directly modify the applications that it bootstraps. It cannot, for example, install an
 * extension in the application. However, it can say it can only bootstrap applications that have the extension
 * installed, failing with a build exception if the developer does not install the extension. As such, the bootstrap app
 * can only setup requirements for the application that it bootstraps. It cannot directly make the needed changes to the
 * bootstrapped application.
 * <p>
 * Bootstrap applications are rarely used directly by users. Instead users typically use thin wrappers such as
 * {@link App} or {@link app.packed.service.ServiceLocator} to create new applications. However, if greater control of
 * the application is needed users may create their own bootstrap application.
 * <p>
 * Normally, you never create more than a single instance of a bootstrap app. Bootstrap applications are, unless
 * otherwise specified, safe to use concurrently.
 *
 * @param <E>
 *            the type of applications this bootstrap app creates

     * An application image is a stand-alone program, derived from an {@link app.packed.container.Assembly}, which runs the

     * <p>
     * By configuring an image ahead of time, the actual time to instantiation the system can be severely decreased often
     * down to a couple of microseconds. In addition to this, images can be reusable, so you can create multiple systems
     * from a single image.

     * Application images typically have two main use cases:
     *
     * GraalVM Native Image
     *
     * Recurrent instantiation of the same application.

     * Creating artifacts in Packed is already really fast, and you can easily create one 10 or hundres of microseconds. But
     * by using artifact images you can into hundres or thousounds of nanoseconds.

     * Use cases: Extremely fast startup.. graal
