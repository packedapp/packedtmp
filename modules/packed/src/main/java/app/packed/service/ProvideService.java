/**
 * An annotation indicating that an annotated method or field on a bean provides a service to the container in which the
 * bean is installed. The key under which the service is registered is return type of the method or the field type
 * respectively.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Both fields and methods can make used of qualifiers to specify the exact key they are made available under. For
 * example, given to two qualifier annotations: {@code @Left} and {@code @Right}<pre>
 *  &#64;Left
 *  &#64;ProvideService
 *  String name = "left";
 *   
 *  &#64;Right
 *  &#64;ProvideService
 *  String provide() {
 *      return "right";
 *  }
 *  </pre>
 * 
 * The field will is made available with the key {@code Key<@Left String>} while the method will be made available with
 * the key {@code Key<@Right String>}.
 * <p>
 * Proving a null value, for example, via a null field or by returning null from a method is illegal unless the
 * dependency is optional.
