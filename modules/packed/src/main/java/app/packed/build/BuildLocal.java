/**
 * Build locals
 * <p>
 * What about ISE do we support valid points you can use a local???
 * <p>
 * Can I set a build local whenever I want or ISE????
 * I would say no, but then again...
 *
 * <p>
 * Build locals are only intended to be used by secure code. Hence there is no support for checking the values that are
 * stored with it.
 * <p>
 * Component locals are only intended to be used at build time. If you need to share state at runtime the right way to
 * do so is by installing a shared bean of some kind
 * <p>
 * Notice: Build locals do do not cache errors thrown from initial suppliers... These are intended to not be handled
 * at build-time. Naah, tror vi gemmer them...
