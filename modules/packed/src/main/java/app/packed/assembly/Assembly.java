/**
 * Assemblies are the basic building block for defining applications in Packed.
 * <p>
 * An assembly provides the concrete instructions for creating an application, and every application is constructed
 * either directly or indirectly from one or more assemblies. As such a single assembly can either comprise the build
 * instructions for an entire application or serve as the root of a hierarchy of assembly nodes, where each node is
 * responsible for building a part of the application.
 * <p>
 * Assemblies provide a simply way to package components and build modular application. This is useful, for example,
 * for:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Sharing functionality across multiple injectors and/or containers.</li>
 * <li>Hiding implementation details from users.</li>
 * <li>Organizing a complex application into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate
 * concern.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Assemblies does not have a runtime representation, they are only used at build time.
 * <p>
 * There are currently two types of assemblies available:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>{@link BaseAssembly}</b> which assemblies information about services, and creates injector instances using
 * .</li>
 * <li><b>{@link BaseAssembly}</b> which assemblies information about both services and components, and creates
 * container instances using .</li>
 * </ul>
 * A assembly instance can be used as part of exactly one ({@link #build()} build-process). Attempting to reuse an
 * assembly will fail with {@link IllegalStateException}.
 * <p>
 * This class cannot be extended directly, you would typically extend {@link BaseAssembly} instead.
