// An Unmanaged Lifetime must not have active threads running inside of it

// An Unmanaged lifetime will never have Managed lifetime as children

// Det her betyder at Injector har en Unmanaged Lifetime.
// Og App har en Managed Lifetime

// Unmanaged Lifetime typically relies on the garbage collection to clean up things.
// Cleaner can be used. But

// Or Tracked vs Untracked

// Unmanaged it is created, but then no longer tracked...

// Applications that are Managed should generally be AutoCloseable
// Or managed by an application host
