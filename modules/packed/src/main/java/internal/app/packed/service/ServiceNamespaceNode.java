// I'm not sure how to best handle this now that service names can span a lot
// At the root of the application??

// And where should I store the service providers???
// We want to check for cycles as early as possible

// Also I think as binding you need to depend on the node instead of the provider.
// We need, for example, the exported key for error messages
