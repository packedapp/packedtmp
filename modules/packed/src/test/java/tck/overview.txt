Tests

Questions: 

// Bruger vi interne APIs? I saa fald er det jo ikke rigtig en TCK


---

Everything in Packed is very connected. It is basically impossible to, for example, create an operation.
Without instantiating a whole application. As a consequence we mainly to whole application tests. Which
are all located in this package and sub packages. 

A lot of the functionality overlap between the different packages. And 

Because everything is so interconnected it is difficult to test only parts of Packed.


--- Types of tests

tck.apps <- test DaemonApp, App, ServiceLocator

tck.naming <- all about naming and paths

tck.mirrors

tck.service?

tck.image <-- Running applications created from an image (Uses BootstrapApp?)

tck.wirelets <- build-time + runtime + All non-extension wirelets

Non-Mirrors <- Configurations?
